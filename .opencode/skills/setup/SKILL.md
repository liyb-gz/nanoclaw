# NanoClaw Setup

Run all commands automatically. Only pause when user action is required (scanning QR codes).

## 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## 2. Install Container Runtime

First, detect the platform and check what's available:

```bash
echo "Platform: $(uname -s)"
which container && echo "Apple Container: installed" || echo "Apple Container: not installed"
which docker && docker info >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "Docker: installed and running" || echo "Docker: not installed or not running"
```

### If NOT on macOS (Linux, etc.)

Apple Container is macOS-only. Use Docker instead.

Tell the user:

> You're on Linux, so we'll use Docker for container isolation. Let me set that up now.

**Use the `/convert-to-docker` skill** to convert the codebase to Docker, then continue to Section 3.

### If on macOS

**If Apple Container is already installed:** Continue to Section 3.

**If Apple Container is NOT installed:** Ask the user:

> NanoClaw needs a container runtime for isolated agent execution. You have two options:
>
> 1. **Apple Container** (default) - macOS-native, lightweight, designed for Apple silicon
> 2. **Docker** - Cross-platform, widely used, works on macOS and Linux
>
> Which would you prefer?

#### Option A: Apple Container

Tell the user:

> Apple Container is required for running agents in isolated environments.
>
> 1. Download the latest `.pkg` from https://github.com/apple/container/releases
> 2. Double-click to install
> 3. Run `container system start` to start the service
>
> Let me know when you've completed these steps.

Wait for user confirmation, then verify:

```bash
container system start
container --version
```

**Note:** NanoClaw automatically starts the Apple Container system when it launches, so you don't need to start it manually after reboots.

#### Option B: Docker

Tell the user:

> You've chosen Docker. Let me set that up now.

**Use the `/convert-to-docker` skill** to convert the codebase to Docker, then continue to Section 3.

## 3. Configure AI Provider Authentication

Ask the user:

> Which AI provider do you want to use? OpenCode supports multiple providers:
>
> 1. **OpenCode Zen** (Recommended) - Curated models tested by OpenCode team
> 2. **Anthropic API key** - Direct Claude access via API
> 3. **OpenAI API key** - GPT models
> 4. **Other provider** - Configure manually

### Option 1: OpenCode Zen (Recommended)

Tell the user:

> Run the following command to authenticate with OpenCode Zen:
>
> ```
> opencode auth login
> ```
>
> Select "opencode" when prompted, then follow the browser authentication flow.

After they complete auth, verify:

```bash
opencode auth list
```

If the provider shows as authenticated, add any needed env vars:

```bash
# OpenCode manages auth internally, but we can add optional env vars
touch .env
```

### Option 2: Anthropic API Key

Ask if they have an existing key to copy or need to create one.

```bash
echo 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=' > .env
```

Tell the user to add their key from https://console.anthropic.com/

**Verify:**

```bash
KEY=$(grep "^ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=" .env | cut -d= -f2)
[ -n "$KEY" ] && echo "API key configured: ${KEY:0:10}...${KEY: -4}" || echo "Missing"
```

### Option 3: OpenAI API Key

```bash
echo 'OPENAI_API_KEY=' > .env
```

Tell the user to add their key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

### Option 4: Other Provider

Tell the user:

> Run `opencode auth login` and select your provider to configure authentication.

## 4. Build Container Image

Build the NanoClaw agent container:

```bash
./container/build.sh
```

This creates the `nanoclaw-agent:latest` image with Node.js, Chromium, OpenCode CLI, and agent-browser.

Verify the build succeeded by running a simple test (this auto-detects which runtime you're using):

```bash
if which docker >/dev/null 2>&1 && docker info >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo '{}' | docker run -i --entrypoint /bin/echo nanoclaw-agent:latest "Container OK" || echo "Container build failed"
else
  echo '{}' | container run -i --entrypoint /bin/echo nanoclaw-agent:latest "Container OK" || echo "Container build failed"
fi
```

## 5. WhatsApp Authentication

**USER ACTION REQUIRED**

Run the authentication script:

```bash
npm run auth
```

Tell the user:

> A QR code will appear. On your phone:
>
> 1. Open WhatsApp
> 2. Tap **Settings → Linked Devices → Link a Device**
> 3. Scan the QR code

Wait for the script to output "Successfully authenticated" then continue.

If it says "Already authenticated", skip to the next step.

## 6. Configure Assistant Name

Ask the user:

> What trigger word do you want to use? (default: `Andy`)
>
> Messages starting with `@TriggerWord` will be sent to the agent.

If they choose something other than `Andy`, update it in these places:

1. `groups/global/AGENTS.md` - Change "# Andy" and "You are Andy" to the new name
2. `groups/main/AGENTS.md` - Same changes at the top
3. `data/registered_groups.json` - Use `@NewName` as the trigger when registering groups

Store their choice - you'll use it when creating the registered_groups.json and when telling them how to test.

## 7. Understand the Security Model

Before registering your main channel, you need to understand an important security concept.

Tell the user:

> **Important: Your "main" channel is your admin control portal.**
>
> The main channel has elevated privileges:
>
> - Can see messages from ALL other registered groups
> - Can manage and delete tasks across all groups
> - Can write to global memory that all groups can read
> - Has read-write access to the entire NanoClaw project
>
> **Recommendation:** Use your personal "Message Yourself" chat or a solo WhatsApp group as your main channel. This ensures only you have admin control.
>
> **Question:** Which setup will you use for your main channel?
>
> Options:
>
> 1. Personal chat (Message Yourself) - Recommended
> 2. Solo WhatsApp group (just me)
> 3. Group with other people (I understand the security implications)

If they choose option 3, ask a follow-up about security implications.

## 8. Register Main Channel

Ask the user:

> Do you want to use your **personal chat** (message yourself) or a **WhatsApp group** as your main control channel?

For personal chat:

> Send any message to yourself in WhatsApp (the "Message Yourself" chat). Tell me when done.

For group:

> Send any message in the WhatsApp group you want to use as your main channel. Tell me when done.

After user confirms, start the app briefly to capture the message:

```bash
timeout 10 npm run dev || true
```

Then find the JID from the database:

```bash
# For personal chat (ends with @s.whatsapp.net)
sqlite3 store/messages.db "SELECT DISTINCT chat_jid FROM messages WHERE chat_jid LIKE '%@s.whatsapp.net' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 5"

# For group (ends with @g.us)
sqlite3 store/messages.db "SELECT DISTINCT chat_jid FROM messages WHERE chat_jid LIKE '%@g.us' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 5"
```

Create/update `data/registered_groups.json` using the JID from above and the assistant name from step 6:

```json
{
  "JID_HERE": {
    "name": "main",
    "folder": "main",
    "trigger": "@ASSISTANT_NAME",
    "added_at": "CURRENT_ISO_TIMESTAMP"
  }
}
```

Ensure the groups folder exists:

```bash
mkdir -p groups/main/logs
```

## 9. Configure External Directory Access (Mount Allowlist)

Ask the user:

> Do you want the agent to be able to access any directories **outside** the NanoClaw project?
>
> Examples: Git repositories, project folders, documents you want the agent to work on.
>
> **Note:** This is optional. Without configuration, agents can only access their own group folders.

If **no**, create an empty allowlist to make this explicit:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/nanoclaw
cat > ~/.config/nanoclaw/mount-allowlist.json << 'EOF'
{
  "allowedRoots": [],
  "blockedPatterns": [],
  "nonMainReadOnly": true
}
EOF
echo "Mount allowlist created - no external directories allowed"
```

Skip to the next step.

If **yes**, collect directory paths and create the allowlist accordingly.

## 10. Configure launchd Service

Generate the plist file with correct paths automatically:

```bash
NODE_PATH=$(which node)
PROJECT_PATH=$(pwd)
HOME_PATH=$HOME

cat > ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist << EOF
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.nanoclaw</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>${NODE_PATH}</string>
        <string>${PROJECT_PATH}/dist/index.js</string>
    </array>
    <key>WorkingDirectory</key>
    <string>${PROJECT_PATH}</string>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <true/>
    <key>EnvironmentVariables</key>
    <dict>
        <key>PATH</key>
        <string>/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:${HOME_PATH}/.local/bin</string>
        <key>HOME</key>
        <string>${HOME_PATH}</string>
    </dict>
    <key>StandardOutPath</key>
    <string>${PROJECT_PATH}/logs/nanoclaw.log</string>
    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
    <string>${PROJECT_PATH}/logs/nanoclaw.error.log</string>
</dict>
</plist>
EOF

echo "Created launchd plist with:"
echo "  Node: ${NODE_PATH}"
echo "  Project: ${PROJECT_PATH}"
```

Build and start the service:

```bash
npm run build
mkdir -p logs
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist
```

Verify it's running:

```bash
launchctl list | grep nanoclaw
```

## 11. Test

Tell the user (using the assistant name they configured):

> Send `@ASSISTANT_NAME hello` in your registered chat.

Check the logs:

```bash
tail -f logs/nanoclaw.log
```

The user should receive a response in WhatsApp.

## Troubleshooting

**Service not starting**: Check `logs/nanoclaw.error.log`

**Container agent fails with "OpenCode process exited with code 1"**:

- Ensure the container runtime is running:
  - Apple Container: `container system start`
  - Docker: `docker info` (start Docker Desktop on macOS, or `sudo systemctl start docker` on Linux)
- Check container logs: `cat groups/main/logs/container-*.log | tail -50`

**No response to messages**:

- Verify the trigger pattern matches (e.g., `@AssistantName` at start of message)
- Check that the chat JID is in `data/registered_groups.json`
- Check `logs/nanoclaw.log` for errors

**WhatsApp disconnected**:

- The service will show a macOS notification
- Run `npm run auth` to re-authenticate
- Restart the service: `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.nanoclaw`

**Unload service**:

```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist
```
